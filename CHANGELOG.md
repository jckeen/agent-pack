# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-18

Initial MVP build of the AgentPack standard + Workgraph Registry monorepo.

- `@workgraph/core`: zod-backed schema, parser, validator, permission summary engine, risk engine, planner, install-plan builder, exportPack convenience entry, and seed-pack module.
- Five adapters: `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `chatgpt` (export-only), `generic`. Deterministic output, BEGIN/END markers in instruction files.
- `@workgraph/cli`: `init`, `validate`, `inspect`, `plan`, `pack export`, `doctor` (commander + picocolors + ora + diff).
- `@workgraph/registry`: Next.js App Router app with `/`, `/packs`, `/packs/[publisher]/[slug]`, `/validate`, `/docs`. Eight local components, Tailwind, seed data, server actions for validation.
- Example pack `examples/pr-quality` exercises every atom type and compiles to all five targets.
- 27 vitest tests across manifest, risk, and adapter coverage.
- README, `docs/agentpack-standard.md`, `docs/security.md`, `docs/adapters.md`, `docs/cli.md`.
- Project ISA at `ISA.md` — 68 testable ISCs covering build, schema, permissions, risk, CLI, adapters, registry, docs, and anti-criteria.
